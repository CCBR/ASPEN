## ASPEN 1.1.1

- Fix Diffatac error (#101, @kopardev)
  - Adds a defensive check to prevent invalid 'row.names' length error when up_roi or down_roi are empty (due to strict FC/FDR thresholds in DiffATAC)
- Minor refactoring to accomodate moving to ccbr_tools >= v0.4 (#101, @kopardev)

## ASPEN 1.1.0

This version features a major overhaul of the pipeline with changes in the following areas:

### Spike-in alignment (#94, @kopardev)

- Added support for spike-in alignment and scaling factor computation. (#94, @kopardev)
- This new feature is controlled by two new parameters in the config file: `spikein` and `spikein_genome`. (#69)

### Peak-calling (#94, @kopardev)

- Peak-called narrowPeak files are now q-value filtered by default, with a default q-value threshold of 0.1. Unfiltered files are still available for users who want to apply their own filters. (#90)
- Streamlined the output directory structure.
- Added the name of the peak-caller to ROI filenames (#86)
- Added missing annotations (#79)

### Differential accessibility (#94, @kopardev)

- Add new rules for scaling counts and annotating regions of interest. (#68)
- DiffATAC analysis is now run for both MACS2 and Genrich peak calls, with results stored in separate directories.
- DiffATAC analysis now includes spike-in scaling factors when `spikein` is `TRUE`.
- Removed redundant steps in the differential accessibility analysis to streamline the process.
- create Tn5-based and reads-based counts matrices (#67)
- create spike-in scaled counts matrices (#62)
- Quality control
  - Updated FRiP calculation to use `tagAlign.gz` files instead of deduplicated BAM files.
  - Removed unnecessary QC metrics and simplified the QC workflow.
  - Updated TSS enrichment and fragment length distribution rules to align with the simplified pipeline structure.

### Output directory (#94, @kopardev)

- Consolidated peak calling outputs into a single directory for each peak caller. (#91)
- Simplified the output directory structure. (#92)
- Decreased output digital footprint by removing unwanted intermediate files, gzipping annotated files, etc. (#87)
- Improved slurm job logging with jobby (now depends on ccbr_tools v0.4). (#98, @kelly-sovacool)

### Documentation (#94, @kopardev)

- Simplified the documentation to focus on the core functionalities of the pipeline, as well as reflect all of the changes in this version.
